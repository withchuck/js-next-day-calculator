Javascript function to calculate day after the current day

Had a use case where the day after the current day needed to be disabled in a calendar widget. Wrote this function to return the day after the passed in day (in mm/dd/yyyy format).

Uses the <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" target="_blank">Vanilla JS</a> library.
